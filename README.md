# pyChatteringy
Create very simple chatbots by using JSON in Python.

WIP

- [x] Make chabot a class (with options to intent paths, etc...)
- [x] Organize code, move to folders, etc...
- [x] Variables
- [ ] Better README
- [ ] `__init__.py` imports
- [ ] More conditions & comparsions (more, less than, not, etc.) - might result in duplicated code, find a way to organize it
- [ ] Basic contextual engine - save users to another JSON file, then ability to use conditions like "hastalked", if bot has talked to that user yet, etc.
- [ ] Other improvements(?)
- [ ] setup.py for PIP
